# Malware Alert Investigation and Validation

## Objective
Detect and validate malware-related alerts generated by endpoint or cloud security controls and perform structured SOC investigation and response.

---

## Threat Description
Malware alerts may be generated due to malicious binaries, suspicious behavior, or false positives.  
SOC analysts must validate alerts to determine true compromise and required response actions.

---

## Data Sources
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts
- Endpoint security alerts
- SIEM (Splunk / Microsoft Sentinel)

---

## Detection Logic
- Ingest malware and threat alerts into SIEM
- Identify alert severity and affected assets
- Correlate alerts with endpoint and identity activity

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- T1204 – User Execution
- T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter
- T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer

---

## SOC Investigation Steps
1. Review malware alert details and severity
2. Identify affected endpoint or cloud resource
3. Analyze file hash and process behavior
4. Review recent authentication and network activity
5. Determine if alert represents true or false positive

---

## Validation Criteria
- Confirm alert source reliability
- Check for repeated or correlated alerts
- Validate whether malware executed successfully

---

## Response Actions
- Isolate affected system if confirmed malicious
- Remove or quarantine malicious artifacts
- Reset credentials if identity compromise is suspected
- Update detection logic to reduce false positives

---

## Notes
This detection focuses on SOC-level alert validation and response rather than malware reverse engineering.
